Subject: [PATCH 02/18] Add isIdle helper

Checks if a buildslave is available and currently idle.  In the case
of a latent buildslave it may be available but not substantiated.  This
helper allows us to determine if a build can be immediately serviced
without the cost of substantiating a new buildslave.
