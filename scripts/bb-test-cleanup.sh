    #    original files (already in the build directory) will not be
    #    replaced.

    #  - If the ".gcno" files *do* have the ".tmp_" prefix, we'll copy
    #    the ".gcno" symlinks contained in the debugfs directory into
    #    the build directory. These symlinks will then point to the
    #    original files with the ".tmp_" prefix.
